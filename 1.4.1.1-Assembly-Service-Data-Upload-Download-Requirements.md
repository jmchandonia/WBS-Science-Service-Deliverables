### Upload requirements

This service depends on the ability to upload sequence reads in FASTA, FASTQ or their compressed formats.

- [ ] SingleEndLibrary: upload multiple single end libraries in FASTA, FASTQ or corresponding bzip/gzip files.
- [ ] PairedEndLibrary: upload multiple paired end libraries in FASTA, FASTQ or corresponding bzip/gzip files.
- [ ] ReferenceAssembly: upload a reference assembly in FASTA

The above uploaded data will be combined and converted to the
AssemblyInput object to be consumed by the assembly service.

### Download requirements

- [ ] ContigSet: the chosen set of assembled contigs in FASTA
- [ ] The assembly report in plain text.
- [ ] A tarball of contig sets, assembly text report, and directories for visual HTML report.
