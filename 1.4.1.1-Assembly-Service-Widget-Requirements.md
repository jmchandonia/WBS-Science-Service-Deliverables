Note: This deliverable is about the requirements, not implementation,
of widgets. We will use checkboxes to track the progress on viewer
implementation. The progress on upload/download widgets is tracked
separately in the data upload/download document linked below. 

### Upload widgets

We need to be able to upload a mixture of single/paired end libraries
and optionally a reference assembly and specify library-specific
parameters. Please see the detailed data type and upload/download
requirements in the related links.

Here's a mockup of the uploader for the reads. It is not implemented.

The three parameters for each paired end library are: insert size,
standard deviation of the insertsize, and whether the leaves are
interleaved. 

### Execution widgets

The user needs to be able to select the assembler, pipeline or recipe
to run on the input reads. These three options should ideally be
implemented as mutually exclusive dropdown tabs.

### Job progress widgets

The user needs to track which stage the assembly job is at. Our
assumption is a system-wide support for long-running job execution and
progress widgets will be in place. This wiget needs to be persistent
across browsing sessions.

### Download widgets

There needs to be download buttons for the user to download a contig
set, an assembly report, and a tarball of results. Please see the
detailed data type and upload/download requirements in the related
links.
