Note: This deliverable is about the requirements, not implementation,
of widgets. We will use checkboxes to track the progress on viewer
implementation. The progress on upload/download widgets is tracked
separately in the data upload/download document linked below. 

### Upload widgets

The user needs to be able to upload a GenBank file or FASTA file
containing assembled contigs.

### Import widgets

We need to support importing a genome from NCBI to be reannotated in KBase.

### Download widgets

The genome object produced by annotation should be downloadable as
FASTA or GenBank.

### Viewers

- [ ] GenomeAnnotation: tabbed viewer for GenomeAnnotation: overview, contigs, and features.
- [ ] KBaseSEEDFunctions: viewer for SEED subsystem data in GenomeAnnotation
