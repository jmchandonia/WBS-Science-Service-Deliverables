Note: This deliverable is about the requirements, not implementation,
of widgets. We will use checkboxes to track the progress on viewer
implementation (most of the viewers already exist). The progress on
upload/download widgets is tracked separately in the data
upload/download document linked below.

### Upload/import widget

The user needs to be able to upload a non-KBase metabolic model in
SBML, Excel or CSV/TSV formats, and the accompanying genome (in the
GenBank format) containing all features mentioned in the model.

Additional support for importing the following typed objects from text
files is needed: KBaseBiochem.Media, KBaseExpression.ExpressionSeries,
KBasePhenotypes.PhenotypeSet, KBaseRegulation.Regulome. See
data type and upload/download requirements linked below for details.

### Download widget

The user needs to be able to download KBaseFBA.FBAModel in SBML,
Excel, and CSV/TSV files.

### Viewer

- [ ] kbaseModelTabs: viewer for metabolic model details
- [ ] compmodels: compare metabolic models
- [ ] kbaseFbaTabsNarrative: viewer for KBaseFBA.FBA
- [ ] FbaModelComparisonWidget: compare FBA results
- [ ] kbaseIntegrateGapfillOutput: viewer for integrated gapfilling output
- [ ] kbaseMediaViewer: viewer for KBaseBiochem.Media
- [ ] kbasePhenotypeSet: viewer for KBasePhenotypes.PhenotypeSet
- [ ] kbasePromConstraint: viewer for KBaseFBA.PromConstraint
- [ ] kbaseSimulationSet: viewer for KBasePhenotypes.PhenotypeSimulationSet
