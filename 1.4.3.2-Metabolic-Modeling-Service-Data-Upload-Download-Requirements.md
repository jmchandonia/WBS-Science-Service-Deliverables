Note: This deliverable is about the requirements, not implementation,
of data upload/download. We will use checkboxes to track the progress
on implementation.

### Upload/import requirements

- [ ] KBaseGenomes.Genome  
      This is covered by the uploader for Genome Annotation service
      (typically in GenBank format). The caveat is that for non-KBase
      models, the accompanying genome that the model represents must
      contain all features mentioned in the model.
	  
- [ ] KBaseFBA.FBAModel (see reference implementation in command `fba-importfbamodel`)
  - [ ] SBML
  - [ ] CSV or TSV (may require multiple tables for one model)
  - [ ] Excel (with support for multiple worksheets)

- [ ] KBaseBiochem.Media (see reference implementation in command `fba-addmedia`)

- [ ] KBaseExpression.ExpressionSeries (see reference implementation in command `fba-importexpression`)

- [ ] KBasePhenotypes.PhenotypeSet (see reference implementation in command `fba-importpheno`)

- [ ] KBaseRegulation.Regulome (see reference implementation in the `import_regulome` function in the Metabolic Modeling service)

### Download requirements

Primary download requirements:

- [ ] KBaseFBA.FBAModel
  - [ ] SBML
  - [ ] CSV or TSV (may require multiple tables for one model)
  - [ ] Excel (with support for multiple worksheets)

The user also needs to be able to download the following data in the
same format they were imported into KBase:

- [ ] KBaseBiochem.Media
- [ ] KBaseExpression.ExpressionSeries
- [ ] KBasePhenotypes.PhenotypeSet
- [ ] KBaseRegulation.Regulome
