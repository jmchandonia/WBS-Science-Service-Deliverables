Note: This deliverable is about the requirements, not implementation,
of widgets. We will use checkboxes to track the progress on viewer
implementation (most of the viewers already exist). The progress on
upload/download widgets is tracked separately in the data
upload/download document linked below.

### Upload/import widgets

No upload widget needed. The servcie uses precomputed/public data.

### Download widgets

All user created data is downloadable via workspace browser.

### Viewers

Assuming a viewer is javascript code which takes a data structure as
input and creates a visualization.

- [ ] `retrieve_annotation_abundance_profile`: generate profile or matrix from metagneome ids
- [ ] `view_abundance_profile_values`: view abundance profile table - sortable, adding and removing columns
- [ ] `boxplots_from_abundance_profile`: view data distribution as bar chart
- [ ] `rank_abundance_from_abundance_profile`: view results as line chart
- [ ] `heatmap_from_abundance_profile`: view results as tree/dendogram
- [ ] `pcoa_from_abundance_profile`: view results as 2D/3D scatter plot
