Note: This deliverable is about the requirements, not implementation,
of widgets. We will use checkboxes to track the progress on viewer
implementation (most of the viewers already exist). The progress on
upload/download widgets is tracked separately in the data
upload/download document linked below.

### Upload/import widgets

None for Feburary.

### Download widgets

The user needs to be able to download multiple sequence alignment as a
FASTA file and phylogenetic tree as a NEWICK text file.

### Viewer widgets

- [ ] kbaseMSA: viewer for multiple sequence alignment
- [ ] kbaseTree: viewer for phylogenetic tree
- [ ] kbaseGenomeSetBuilder: build a genome set (KBaseSearch.GenomeSet) from tree

#### Apps that rely on this science service:

- Insertion of Genomes into Phylogenetic Species Tree
- Build and view an alignment and tree for a set of gene sequences (not listed as a target for February)
