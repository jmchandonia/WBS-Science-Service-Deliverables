Note: This deliverable is about the requirements, not implementation,
of data upload/download. We will use checkboxes to track the progress
on implementation.

### Upload/import requirements

- [ ] KBaseGenomes.Genome  
      This is covered by the uploader for Genome Annotation service
      (typically in Fasta format). The caveat is that for non-KBase
      models, the accompanying genome that the model represents must
      contain all features mentioned in the model.

### Download requirements

Primary download requirements:

- [ ] KBaseFBA.FBAModel
  - [ ] SBML
  - [ ] CSV or TSV (may require multiple tables for one model)
  - [ ] Excel (with support for multiple worksheets)

- [ ] KBaseGenomes.Genome
